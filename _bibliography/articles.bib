  abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a new numerical method with asymptotic stability properties for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The foundations for the new solver are the Steklov mean and an exact discretization for the deterministic version of the SDEs. Strong consistency and convergence properties are demonstrated for the proposed method. Moreover, a rigorous linear and nonlinear asymptotic stability analysis is carried out for the multiplicative case in a mean-square sense and for the additive case in a path-wise sense using the pullback limit. In order to emphasize the characteristics of the Steklov discretization we use as benchmarks the stochastic logistic equation and the Langevin equation with a nonlinear potential of the Brownian dynamics. We show that the Steklov method has mild stability requirements and allows long-time simulations in several applications.}},

Also, we present numerical evidence that the explicit linear Steklov reproduces almost surely stability solutions with high-accuracy for diverse application models even for stochastic differential systems with super-linear diffusion coefficients.}},

For this purpose, we construct a stochastic differential model for the interactions between the osteoclast and osteoblast cell populations using the parameter perturbation technique. We prove the existence of a globally attractive positive unique solution for the stochastically perturbed system. Also, the stochastic boundedness of the solution is demonstrated using its p-th order moments for p ≥ 1. Finally, we show that the introduction of noise in the deterministic model provides a fluctuating periodic solution. Numerical evidence supports our theoretical results and a discussion of the results is carried out.}},

  abstract = {{About a year into the pandemic, COVID-19 accumulates more than two million deaths worldwide. Despite non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distance, mask-wearing, and restrictive lockdown, the daily confirmed cases remain growing. Vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna, and Gamaleya Institute reach more than 90\% efficacy and sustain the vaccination campaigns in multiple countries. However, natural and vaccine-induced immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but the new SARS-CoV-2 variants demand to inquire if the vaccines will be highly protective or induce permanent immunity. Further, in the first quarter of 2021, vaccine supply is scarce. Consequently, some countries that are applying the Pfizer vaccine will delay its second required dose. Likewise, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. Therefore, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Following some of the WHO-SAGE recommendations, we formulate an optimal control problem with mixed constraints to describe vaccination schedules. Our solution identifies vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost. These optimal policies ensure the vaccination coverage of a prescribed population fraction in a given time horizon and preserve hospitalization occupancy below a risk level. We explore “via simulation” plausible scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced, and natural immunity. Our simulations suggest that response regarding vaccine-induced immunity and reinfection periods would play a dominant role in mitigating COVID-19.}},

  abstract = {{Metaheuristic algorithms are typically used for optimizing a function f : A → R , where A is a subset of R N . Nevertheless, many real-life problems require A to be a set of functions which makes f a functional. In this paper, we present a methodology to address the optimization of functionals by using the evolutionary algorithm known as Differential Evolution. Unlike traditional techniques where continuity and differentiability assumptions are required to solve some associated differential equations—like calculus of variations, Pontryagin’s principle or dynamic programming, the optimization is carried out directly on the functional without the need of any of the assumptions mentioned before. Lagrangians involving derivatives are considered, these derivatives are computed implementing Automatic Differentiation with dual numbers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a metaheuristic optimization approach has been applied to directly optimize a broad variety of functionals. The effectiveness of our methodology is validated by solving two problems. The first problem is related to the implementation of quarantine and isolation in SARS epidemics and the second validation problem deals with the well-known brachistochrone curve problem. The results of both validation problems are in outstanding agreement with those obtained with the application of traditional techniques, specifically with the Forward–Backward-Sweep method in the first problem, and with the calculus of variations for the latter problem. We also found that interpolation may be employed to solve the large scale global optimization problems arisen in the optimization of functionals.}},
