Traffic Policies and Best Response Optimal Control</h2>
<p>The number of individual in a gathering could play an important role
for control the spread of COVID-19. By controlling the size of meetings,
we can mitigate the propagation of new infections. However, this sort of
restrictions has to be aligned with a delicate balance between the
social and political implications. Then epidemiologists and government
consuls has to deduce a policy accordingly. That is, balance between the
cost and profit to limit the size of meetings and restrictions that
affect the mobility, mask wearing and others NPIs.</p>
<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<p>We denote by <span
class="math inline">\(u=u(\varphi(x^\top))\)</span> the control function
regarding the implicit state <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
Here the function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>
classifies the dynamic state <span class="math inline">\(x=x(t)\)</span>
according to light traffic green, yellow, orange, red. This colors
corresponds to the severity and risk of the actual outbreak and
according to the following criteria. Conforming to the prevalence <span
class="math inline">\(I(t)\)</span>, Risk <span
class="math inline">\(C(I)\)</span>, and time reproductive numbe <span
class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> we classify the state <span
class="math inline">\(x_0^\top = (S, I, V, R, C)\)</span> as TODO:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Green</dt>
<dd>
<p>The prevalence is less than <span class="math inline">\(10\%\)</span>
of the active population, the Risk index is below 0.3 and <span
class="math inline">\(R_t\)</span> oscillates between <span
class="math inline">\([0, 0.7]\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Yellow</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>Red</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then the function <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> maps
the initial state <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> to a
light-trafficâ€™s color, that is, <span class="math display">\[\varphi:
        x_0
        \to
            \{
                \text{green},
                \text{yelolw},
                \text{orange},
                \text{red}
        \}\]</span>. To evaluate the performance of each strategy, we
define the following cost functional. <span class="math display">\[J(x,
u_{\beta}, u_k):=
        \underbrace{
        \int_{0}^T
                a_I I(s) + a_C C(s)
            }_{YLD+Risk}
        ds
        +
        \underbrace{
            \int_{0}^T
                a_{\beta} u_{\beta}^2(s)
                +
                a_k u_k(s)^2
            }_{\text{political and economic implications}}
        ds\]</span> Here we understand the politic and economic impact
by apply a given light traffic policy as the cost that implies its
application and we describe it by the quadratic form <span
class="math display">\[a_{\beta} u_{beta} ^2 + a_k u_k^2\]</span></p>
<h4 id="control-measures">Control measures</h4>
<p>In the same line we define mitigation protocols according to the
color of light-traffic being:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Green</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only prevail the mask wearing and health distance</p>
</dd>
<dt>Yellow</dt>
<dd>
<p>We understand this set of strategies as a preventive. Social events
restricted and mobility diminished, so that the conventional mobility
and other protocols reduce the nominal transmission rate <span
class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> and meeting-size <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to its <span
class="math inline">\(85\%\)</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Orange</dt>
<dd>
<p>The strategies enclosed in this category aim to apply more
restrictive protocols to quickly reduce the prevalence, but at the same
time allows enough mobility. Here, the decision maker tray to minimize
the impact of economic implications.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Red</dt>
<dd>
<p>This set of strategies responds to an emergency state. Here the
infection prevalence points to exceed the response of Health services.
Thus the decision maker reduce to the minimum the mobility and size of
meetings.</p>
</dd>

<h4 id="light-traffic-policies">Light Traffic Policies</h4>
<h4 id="problem-set-up">Problem set up</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x_0 =(S(0), I(0), V(0), R(0),
C(0))^{\top}\)</span> the initial state of system <a href="#eq.model"
data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq.model">[eq.model]</a>.
Thus, according to the above classification, we assign an initial color
for the light-traffic controller. We assume the following
hypothesis.</p>
<div class="hypothesis">
<p><strong>Hypotesis 1</strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>The decision maker only choose a strategy of the mentioned
above and accordingly to the light traffic protocol. That is, the
controller decides which color from the plausible light-traffic action
being {green, yellow, orange, red } the available actions.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The corresponding authorities meet every certain number of
weeks on a regular basis and takes a decision.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The taken decision minimize the functional <span

<p>Then, under the above Hypothesis, our simulation algorithm follows
the next algorithm.</p>
