Current software counts. Excellent tools in their latest versions make the
rocket engine for each and every website. Jekyll One is using current software
in their latest versions. All of them are OpenSource and free to use.
No license issues for private or professional use.

== Platforms

J1 Template is based on these popular software platforms:

mdi:language-ruby[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
Ruby 2.7 +
mdi:language-ruby[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
Jekyll 4.2 +
mdi:nodejs[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
NodeJS 12.x

All software-platforms are OpenSource, free to use and available on all
common operating systems like Windows, Linux, and OSX.

=== Ruby and Jekyll

The template system J1 is based on the Ruby language of version
2.x. For sure, not the latest language version for Ruby but the
supported platform for the latest Jekyll software.

=== NodeJS

Websites created by Jekyll One are projects managed by NodeJS. The
built-in script engine provided by the package manager `npm` of NodeJS
simplifies the management of J1 projects a lot. Well-known commands
typically used to manage software projects are at your fingertips.
Easy to learn, easy to remember. Commands support creators to
concentrate on the content.

== Frameworks

To no reinvent wheels, J1 Template is based on ready-to-use frameworks,
extensions, and modules. All build-in frameworks are industry standard,
well known, and accepted worldwide.

mdi:bootstrap[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
Bootstrap V5 +
mdi:language-html5[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
HTML5, CSS and Javascript +
mdi:grass[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
Icon Fonts +
mdi:application-settings[24px, md-blue ml-3 mr-2]
Fully configurable components +

=== Bootstrap V5

For current webs, a must: responsiveness and modern design. Jekyll One is
based on Bootstrap V5, the leading platform to create today's responsive webs.

=== HTML5, CSS and Javascript

Professional websites on the internet define standards. All
current sites support dynamic, fast loading, and some more features.
For fastest loading, all HTML, CSS, and Javascript have been compressed
automatically for production. Going further for dynamic, AJAX loading
for J1 webs is supported as well.

=== Icon Fonts

No question, icons and icon fonts are essentially required to make a site
better understandable. Icons are used for navigation, extensions, modules,
and last but not least for the content.

J1 Template supports popular icons font sets out-of-the-box:

* link:{url-mdi--home}[Material Design Icons, {browser-window--new}] (MDI)
* link:{url-fontawesome--home}[FontAwesome Icons V5, {browser-window--new}] (FAI)
* link:{url-iconify--home}[Iconify Icons, {browser-window--new}] (ICI)

All the icon sets are excellent in design and have a rich set of icons in
various categories typically used for the Web.

=== Fully configurable components

Software products of today are not easy to manage. To get the complexity
out of your way, J1 is fully configurable. No need to dive in the deep.

=== Desktop and Mobile support

The internet has shifted from almost exclusively desktop-driven to mostly
mobile-driven nowadays. Just a decade ago, in 2010, over 90 percent of all
global web traffic came from desktop computers. The percentage of global web
traffic on mobile phones has surged over the past decade. As of July 2021,
more than 50 percent of all web traffic came through mobile devices.

.Global mobile traffic, 2011-2021
lightbox::broadbandsearch--global-mobile-traffic[ 800, {data-broadbandsearch--global-mobile-traffic} ]

Source: link:{url-broadbandsearch--mobile-internet-usage}[broadbandsearch.net, {browser-window--new}]

As of 2021, more than 50 percent of the total web visits are currently mobile.
For this reason, it is very important to provide good useability of your
website for mobile devices.

=== Mobile Web Navigation

Mobile devices are great for Apps designed for these platforms. Using a web
browser to surf websites is often frustrating on mobiles. Jekyll One provides
navigation systems that cover both worlds: desktops and mobiles.

=== Google Lighthouse scores

Performance is a key factor for all users. To not get visitors lost, J1 webs
are highly optimized. All Websites will achieve the  best Google Lighthouse
scores for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO at the green
level.
