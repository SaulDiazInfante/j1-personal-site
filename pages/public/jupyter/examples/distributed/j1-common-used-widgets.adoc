                                        The package nbinteract aims to enable authors and educators to create and
                                        share interactive web pages easily. Interactive explanations of concepts are
                                        useful for communicating and explaining tricky concepts.

CAUTION: Each interactive element presented on this page uses *time-consuming*
operations that take a while to finish. The elements are built through a
backend in the cloud. Please be patient to see the results.

*Widgets* are eventful python objects that have a representation in the browser,
often as a control like as sliders, textboxes, dowpdowns etc. Widgets may used
to build *interactive* GUIs for your notebooks, and to synchronize stateful and
stateless information between the (IPython-)Kernel and JavaScript.

Many libraries are available for Jupyter (IPython) to choose from. One of the
most commonly used libraries for widgets is *IPyWidgets* and the visualizations
(plots) of *Matplotlib*, *BQplot* or *GGplot*.

In addition to the popular widgets, the NBI module offers additional GUI
elements via the integrated interact-core library, which are useable in a
very simple way.

Find with that page a commonly used set of widgets for interactive textbooks.
Some more options are available for interactivity, but this selection shows
the most used. Interactive widgets are provided natively by Jupyter Notebooks
using the library `ipywidgets`. Find common examples in the textbooks below.

== Widgets from ipywidgets

The library *ipywidgets*, also known as *jupyter-widgets*, are interactive
HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Notebooks come
alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data
and can visualize changes in the data.

textbook::j1_interactive_widgets[]

== Widgets from nbinteract

The library *nbinteract* comes with a set of functions that produce
Javascript-based plots designed for interaction. The package combines the
*ipywidgets* library and the *bqplot* plotting library to implement
function-driven interfaces to interactive plotting.

CAUTION: The current version of j1-nbinteract *1.x* is limited to Notebook v6
(Classic Notebook). The latest version Jupyter Notebook v7 (JupyterLab) are
supported by upcoming versions of j1-nbinteract *2.x*.

The nbinteract plotting methods use **ipywidgets** to generate and display
widgets, inferring the widget type as needed. When a user interacts with a
widget, a Python callback updates the visualization **without** a complete
rerender. This noticeably lowers visualization update time compared to using
ipywidgets alone to render static images.

=== Histogram

The  widget `nbinteract.hist` generates a histogram that allows interaction
with the parameters for the response function. The widget takes in a single
response function. The response function returns the array of numerical values
that will be shown in the histogram. The hist function allows interaction with
the response function's parameters by specifying them as keyword arguments
in the same format as ipywidgets.interact. Any argument that can be used for
`ipywidgets.interact` can be used for hist.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_hist_chart[]

=== Bar chart

The widget `nbinteract.bar` generates an bar plot that allows interaction
with the parameters for the response functions.

The first two arguments of bar are response functions that return the x and
y-axis data arrays, respectively. Either argument can be arrays themselves.
Arguments for the response functions must be passed in as keyword arguments
to bar in the format expected by interact. The response function for the
y-axis data will be called with the x-axis data as its first argument.

For example, in the bar plot below categories generates the categories to
plot on the x-axis and heights generates the y-axis heights. The heights
function uses the parameter xs which is the array of x-axis data points.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_bar_chart[]

=== Interactive Scatter chart

The widget `nbinteract.scatter_drag` generates a scatter plot that allows
interaction through clicking and dragging the points on the graph.
`scatter_drag` takes in two lists/arrays consisting of the x-coordinates
and y-coordinates of the points to plot. It generates an interactive
scatter plot where the points can be dragged by the user and a best fit
line is updated automatically according to the placement of the points.

WARNING: The widget `scatter_drag` does *not* allow response functions
as inputs.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_scatter_drag_chart[]

=== Scatter chart

The widget `nbinteract.scatter` generates a scatter plot that allows
interaction with the parameters to the response functions. This is different
from `scatter_drag` which facilitates interaction using click and drag
actions.

The first two arguments of scatter are response functions that return the
x and y-axis coordinates, respectively. Either argument can be arrays
themselves. Arguments for the response functions must be passed in as
keyword arguments to scatter in the format expected by interact.
The response function for the y-coordinates will be called with the
x-coordinates as its first argument.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_scatter_chart[]

=== Line chart

The `nbinteract.line` widget generates a line plot that allows interaction
with the parameters to the response functions. The first two arguments of line
are response functions that return the x and y-axis coordinates, respectively.
Either argument can be arrays themselves.

Arguments for the response functions must be passed in as keyword arguments
to line in the format expected by interact. The response function for the
y-coordinates will be called with the x-coordinates as its first argument.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_line_chart[]

=== Interactive questions

To enable educators to create and share interactive web pages for learning,
beside widgets for plotting interactive widgets for asking questions are
available as well.

==== Multiple choice

The widget `nbinteract.multiple_choice` takes a question, a list of possible
answer choices, and the correct answer. Clicking the buttons shows whether
the choice was correct.

textbook::j1_nbi_widgets_question_multiple_choice[]

==== Short answer

The widget `nbinteract.short_answer` takes a question and an answer. The
answer can either be a string, a list of strings, or a function that
returns `True` when called with the user's input. If the function errors,
an error message will be displayed.
