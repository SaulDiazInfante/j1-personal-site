== Abstract
Diseases transmitted by vectors in crops represent a severe risk to
the farmer, causing low production and lower quality, which results
in a drastic reduction in crop yield. Here we study a stochastic
plant-vector-host epidemic model with direct transmission.
Perturbing with Brownian motion plant replanting and vector
fumigation rates, we formulate an Ito stochastic differential
equations that capture the uncertainty of the controls.
We derive conditions to assure extinction and persistence
of disease using two different stochastic versions of the so-called
basic reproductive number.
Finally, we verify and illustrate our theory by numerical experiments.
Our simulations suggest that uncertainty could drive dramatic stability changes.
Because in practice, to confirm an infected plant via laboratory
tests is not necessarily feasible, replanting and fumigation strategies
suffer considerable uncertainty.
Here, we quantify and study the impact and consequences of this uncertainty.
We conclude that environmental noise promotes dramatic stability
changes.

== Introduction

Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is the responsible vector for
critical insect-transmitted diseases in crops like
tomato, soybeans, and cotton
+++{% cite Yan2021 faiz2021 Swathi2021 Ali2021 %}+++.
Begomoviruses transmitted by this insect provoke reductions in the
production and quality of this and other products in India, Mexico,
USA, Colombia, and other producer countries
+++{% cite Li2021 Lee2021 %}+++.
For example, Tomato Yellow Curl Lives (TYCL) disease cause that tomato
plants to become futile and diminish their growth
+++{% cite Yan2021 Cohen2007 %}+++.

Despite control strategies like fumigation or replanting,
it is complicated to eradicate this vector. This insect has
sophisticated survival mechanism that permits shelter itself
in another perennial--and abundant on the borders of
the plantation--insecticide-resistant plants.
Thus, fumigation promotes partial migration instead of extinction.
In addition, plant symptoms like curl leaves and yellow
discolouration also are associated with iron or phosphate soil
deficiencies. Consequently, control methods like replanting
neighbours or physical barriers suffer from high
uncertainty--a farmer could replant a healthy plant instead of
a latent one and vice-versa.

There is well-established literature that treats deterministic
models for vector plant structures. Our primary reference is the work of
+++{% cite Holt1999 Cohen2007 Chan1994 %}+++ and other important reference.
Recently, control strategies have been studied as optimal control
problems by Lenhart et al. in
+++{% cite Bokil2019 %}+++
for a tomato diseaseand Luo et al. +++{% cite Luo2021 %}+++ for Huanglongbing.
However, the uncertainty quantification or stochastic counterparts
still are under development. In this direction, we mention the
recent works of Allen et al. +++{% cite Hebert2016 %}+++, Stella \& Ghosh
+++{% cite Stella2019 %}+++ Agarwal et al. +++{% cite Agarwal2019 %}+++,
and Chen-Charpentier +++{% cite Chen-Charpentier2021 %}+++
as significant contributions.

Here, we aim to quantify the uncertainty due to possible errors
in identifying infected plants and random fluctuations of vector
migration produced in fumigation. Our study attempts to capture
the impact of ambient noise and try to explain it by formal
analysis and simulation.

According to Britton et al. +++{% cite Britton2019 %}+++, stochastic effects
of an epidemic model are essential when the underlying
population size is relatively small (at most hundreds).
However, recently have been reported studies that attempt
the same methodology of deterministic models in
mathematical epidemiologyâ€”being positivity,
invariance, extinction, and persistence the primary
objects of study. In respect of this regard, we refer
the reader to
+++{% cite Gray2011 Cao2016a Acuna-Zegarra2018 %}+++.
However, the application to a specific disease
driven with data is still under development.
Roughly speaking, the methodology bases
the analysis on study versions of a SIR structure
and characterizes conditions to extinction-persistence
for a convenient definition of a stochastic
reproductive number, see
+++{% cite Cao2016a  ZhaoJiang2015 Rifhat2021 Ji2014 %}+++.

Regarding plant-vector-host structures, we see relevant
the contributions of Allen et al. +++{% cite Gray2011 %}+++
and Agarwal et al. +++{% cite Agarwal2019 %}+++.
These works would apply the most common techniques to
formulate stochastic models for epidemics
based on Ito differential equations. Agarwal studied
pine wilt disease with a stochastic optimal control
problem, where the controls are related to prevention and
fumigation. Allen considers a stochastic plant-vector-host
structure deduced as the limit of a Continuous Markov chain
model. With this structure, Allen et al. study the effects
of vector aggregation and dispersal subject to noise.
On this occasion, we deploy a compartmental $SLI-SI$
plant vector structure with Brownian noise by formulating
an It\^{o} stochastic differential equation (SDE).
Our main results characterize conditions to assure
extinction and persistence.
First, we identify requirements to ensure extinction
due only to noise intensity. Then, for sufficiently small noise, we
develop the threshold theory for two proposals of the
stochastic reproductive number. Finally, we verify and
illustrate our results by numerical simulation.

We aim to quantify the effects of uncertainty
of the mentioned controls over the extinction and persistence
of the disease.
We conclude that noise would play a crucial role
in the trade-off between extinction and persistence.
In other words, the combination of errors due by plant
identification and random fluctuations of vector migration
would lead to the death of healthy and infected plants and or
its prevalence.
Consequently, the local behaviour of vectors follows similar
codependency.

Using the package **DifferentialEquation.jl** from *Julia*
+++{% cite rackauckas2017differentialequations %}+++, we simulate
our stochastic model. This package provides the most
recent solvers for stiff It\^{o} problems.
We apply the parallel implementation of **S-ROCK** method
+++{% cite Abdulle2008 %}+++---getting a stable, and high convergent
simulation of \numprint{10000} paths after a reasonable computational
time.
Our simulations suggest that environmental noise induces large dispersion.
Thus, we deduce that uncertainty would lead to unexpected results.
Therefore, a significant implication is related to the good identification
of healthy crops---our recommendation is to balance replanting
with efficiency.

After this brief introduction, in link:#sec:model_formulation[Section 2]
we discuss the dynamic properties of the deterministic base. Then, Section
link:#sec:stochastic_extension[Section 3] extends this base by stochastic
perturbation to formulate our SDE model.  link:#sec:solution_existence[Section 4]
deploys the results about the existence and uniqueness of the global
positivity solution. After that, Section link:#sec:extinction[Section 5] characterizes
conditions on the noise intensity and other parameters to assure disease
extinction.  Then we complete the analysis with results to ensure disease
persistence in link:#sec:persistence[Section 6]. Finally, we verify and
illustrate our theory in Section link:#sec:numerics[Section 7].

== Deterministic base dynamics
Here, we adapt the deterministic dynamics presented by
Holt et al. \cite{Holt1999}. Following the authors,
we split the plant population according to,
susceptible $ (S_p) $, latent $ (L_p) $, and infected
$ (I_p) $. And divide vector population into susceptible
$S_v$ and $I_v$ infected classes.
We consider the following assumptions: Susceptible plants become latent
plants when an infected vector feeds on them at constant rate, $\beta_p$.
Latent plants become infected plants at a rate of $b$. We replant latent and
infected plants that are detected at rate $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively.
Removed plants are replanting as susceptible plants in the crop.
For vector dynamics, we consider that susceptible vectors become acquirer
disease, at rate $\beta_v$, when they eat an infected plant. We assume natural
vector die at rate $\gamma$, and by fumigation at rate $\gamma_f$. A proportion
of the susceptible and infected vectors migrates from alternatives host plants
to the crop.


With these hypotheses, the model has the following equations

	\begin{equation}
		\label{sys::DeterministicSystem}
		\begin{aligned}
			\dot{S_p} &=
				-\beta_p S_p
				\frac{I_v}{N_v} + r_1 L_p + r_2 I_p
			\\
			\dot{L_p} &=
				\beta_p S_p
				\frac{I_v}{N_v} - (b + r_1) L_p
			\\
			\dot{I_p} &=
				b L_p - r_2 I_p  \\
			\dot{S_v} &=
				-\beta_v S_v
				\frac{I_p}{N_p} - (\gamma + \gamma_f) S_v
				+(1-\theta) \mu
			\\
			\dot{I_v} &=
				\beta_v S_v \frac{I_p}{N_p}
				- (\gamma + \gamma_f) I_v
				+ \theta \mu
				 \\
				S_p(0) &=S_{p0},
				L_p(0) = L_{p0},
				I_p(0) = I_{p0},
				\\
				 S_v(0) &= S_{v0},
				  I_v(0) = I_{v0},
				 \\
				 N_p(t) &= S_p(t) + L_p(t) + I_p(t),
				 \\
				 N_v(t) &= S_v(t) + I_v(t).
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
++++
We conduct a calibration of the model \eqref{sys::DeterministicSystem}
based on the parameters and data reported in \cite{Holt1999} and  via
Multi Chain Montecarlo Method (MCMC). Here we used the R-Stan
implementation and followed the workflow from \cite{Grinsztajn2021}.
We refer the reader to the supplementary material \cite{Salcedo-varela2021}
for more details.
