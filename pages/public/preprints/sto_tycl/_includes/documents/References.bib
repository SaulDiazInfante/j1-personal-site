Investigating the basic reproductive number, we proved that it has sharp threshold properties. The underlying system of stochastic differential equations is analyzed, and proper Lyapunov functionals are formulated to show the stability analysis. Adequate conditions are provided to study the extinction and permanence of the disease. Reducing infected individuals involved in a substance abuse is a challenging task therefore, using some control variables the stochastic optimality system, is obtained. Furthermore, for the authenticity of the obtained results numerical simulations are carried out at the end of the manuscript.},

The model considers biocontrol systems for foliar pathogens only and, although it is most applicable to fungal BCA systems, does not address a specific biocontrol system. Four biocontrol mechanisms (competition, antibiosis, mycoparasitism and induced resistance) were included within the model rubric. Because of the wide range of mechanisms involved we use Trichoderma/Botrytis as an exemplar system. Qualitative analysis of the model showed that the rates of a BCA colonising diseased and/or healthy plant tissues and the time that the BCA remains active are two of the more important factors in determining the final outcome of a biocontrol system. Further evaluation of the model indicated that the dynamic path to the steady-state population levels also depends critically on other parameters such as the host-pathogen infection rate. In principle, the model can be extended to include other potential mechanisms, including spatio-temporal heterogeneity, fungicide effects, non-fungal BCA and strategies for BCA application, although with a cost in model tractability and ease of interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

B. tabaci first recorded as early as in 1940s in China and has been reported as a pest of various crops in 22 provinces or cities. But only recently it has become a severe problem for vegetable and ornamental crops in Guangdong and Beijing. In China B. tabaci is known to transmit at least 5 plant viruses, including tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato leaf curl virus (TomLCV), squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV-C). So far, approximately 18 parasitoids, 17 predators and 1 pathogenic fungus were recorded in China. This paper presents an overview of B. tabaci as a pest and virus vector in China, with special attention given to non-chemical control strategies. {\textcopyright} 2017 Wiley. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {Plant viruses are an important constraint to crop production worldwide. Rarely have plant virologists, vector entomologists and crop specialists worked together in search of sustainable management practices for viral diseases. Historically, modelling approaches have been vector-based dealing with empirical forecasting systems or simulation of vector population dynamics. More recently, epidemiological models, such as those used in human/animal epidemiology, have been introduced in an attempt to characterize and analyse the population ecology of viral diseases. The theoretical bases for these models and their use in evaluating control strategies in terms of the interactions between host, virus and vector are considered here. Vector activity and behaviour, especially in relation to virus transmission, are important determinants of the rate and extent of epidemic development. The applicability and flexibility of these models are illustrated by reference to specific case studies, including the increasing importance of whitefly-transmitted viruses. Some outstanding research and methodological issues are considered.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The infectivity period of infected individuals can be influenced dynamically by a decision maker, with the aim to minimize the expected aggregated economic costs due to illness and drug treatment. This stochastic control problem is investigated under two alternative assumptions about the information available. If a complete and exact measurement of the size of the infected population is available at any time, then the optimal control is sought in a state-feedback form and the related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation can be used. If no state measurement is available, then the optimal control is sought in an open-loop form and the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem for the Kolmogorov forward equation. In both cases, deriving optimality conditions requires non-standard arguments due to the degeneracy of the involved HJB and Kolmogorov equations. Based on the obtained theoretical results, the role of the information pattern is numerically investigated.},

    abstract = {1. A number of insect vectors of plant-virus diseases make only transitory visits to the crop in which the economic effects of the disease are important. The incidence of disease in the crop depends primarily on the immigration of vectors from alternative hosts which act as a reservoir of both the virus and vector. 2. An epidemiological model was developed to represent this situation and parameters were estimated for the case of tomato leaf curl virus disease (TLCVD) (Geminiviridae, Subgroup III) in India. From an analysis of the model, the following possibilities for the management of TLCVD emerged. 3. It was clear that varietal resistance to infection could be an important component of disease management but whether, once infected, the tomato plants acted as a source of inoculum had little impact on disease incidence in the tomato crop. 4. A very low rate of simulated vector immigration into a tomato crop sufficed to cause almost total infection. Around Bangalore, vectors may migrate into tomato crops in numbers in excess of those required for disease 'saturation', explaining why, using conventional insecticides, very efficient and intensive vector control is currently required to reduce disease incidence. 5. Disease incidence was sensitive to vector mortality only when vector numbers were low. In most cases, the immigration of viruliferous vectors made disease incidence insensitive to the mortality of vectors within the tomato crop. 6. A strategy for disease management which targets more than one of the parameters to which the model proved most sensitive is likely to be necessary. In particular, the use of protective netting combined with the growing of resistant varieties has the potential to reduce both B. tabaci immigration to the crop and to reduce virus inoculation by those insects which do reach the crop.},

Beginning with a simple population model, the concept is developed for a threshold value of ℛ0 determining whether or not the disease dies out. The next generation matrix method of calculating ℛ0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are defined, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate ℛ0 are given. These are useful for more complicated models that, for example, take account of variations in environmental fluctuation or stochasticity.},

    abstract = {1. The dynamics of a virus disease in a perennial plant population are modelled. The population is divided into healthy, latently infected, infectious and post-infectious plants and linked differential equations describe the dynamics of each category. 2. Qualitative analysis of this model shows stable dynamics and threshold conditions for disease persistence. Stable equilibria are reached after several years. The dynamics of the model are highly sensitive to changes in contact rate and infectious period. 3. Disease management by roguing (removal) of infected plants and replanting with healthy ones is investigated. Roguing only in the post-infectious category confers no advantage. At low contact rates, roguing only when plants become infectious is sufficient to eradicate the disease. At high contact rates, roguing latently infected as well as infectious plants is advisable. 4. With disease present the equilibrium level of healthy plants does not depend on replanting rate, but at higher replanting rates the disease is more difficult to eradicate. There is a trade-off between roguing and replanting in designing optimal disease management strategies. 5. Using parameter values estimated from field studies on three plant virus diseases, the model indicates that eradication is achievable with realistic roguing intensities.},

    abstract = {Vector-transmitted diseases of plants have had devastating effects on agricultural production worldwide, resulting in drastic reductions in yield for crops such as cotton, soybean, tomato, and cassava. Plant-vector-virus models with continuous replanting are investigated in terms of the effects of selection of cuttings, roguing, and insecticide use on disease prevalence in plants. Previous models are extended to include two replanting strategies: frequencyreplanting and abundance-replanting. In frequency-replanting, replanting of infected cuttings depends on the selection frequency parameter $\epsilon$, whereas in abundance-replanting, replanting depends on plant abundance via a selection rate parameter also denoted as $\epsilon$. The two models are analysed and new thresholds for disease elimination are defined for each model. Parameter values for cassava, whiteflies, and African cassava mosaic virus serve as a case study. A numerical sensitivity analysis illustrates how the equilibrium densities of healthy and infected plants vary with parameter values. Optimal control theory is used to investigate the effects of roguing and insecticide use with a goal of maximizing the healthy plants that are harvested. Differences in the control strategies in the two models are seen for large values of $\epsilon$. Also, the combined strategy of roguing and insecticide use performs better than a single control.},

    abstract = {Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) has emerged as a serious threat to food security in sub-Saharan Africa. MLN is caused by coinfection with two viruses, Maize chlorotic mottle virus and a potyvirus, often Sugarcane mosaic virus. To better understand the dynamics of MLN and to provide insight into disease management, we modeled the spread of the viruses causing MLN within and between growing seasons. The model allows for transmission via vectors, soil, and seed, as well as exogenous sources of infection. Following model parameterization, we predict how management affects disease prevalence and crop performance over multiple seasons. Resource-rich farmers with large holdings can achieve good control by combining clean seed and insect control. However, crop rotation is often required to effect full control. Resource-poor farmers with smaller holdings must rely on rotation and roguing, and achieve more limited control. For both types of farmer, unless management is synchronized over large areas, exogenous sources of infection can thwart control. As well as providing practical guidance, our modeling framework is potentially informative for other cropping systems in which coinfection has devastating effects. Our work also emphasizes how mathematical modeling can inform management of an emerging disease even when epidemiological information remains scanty.},

The purpose was to reveal differences in residual efficacy of four materials that are nearing registration for use on tomato-cyazypyr, flupyradifurone, pyrafluquinazon, and sulfoxaflor-and to compare them with two established insecticides, pymetrozine and a zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin combination. Differences in efficacy were expected because these six materials represent five distinct modes of action and both contact and systemic materials. Percentage of tomato seedlings expressing virus symptoms tended to be lowest in seedlings treated with flupyradifurone. The zeta-cypermethrin/bifenthrin insecticide demonstrated comparable efficacy to flupyradifurone in some trials at 3 and 7 d after treatment inoculations, but not the 14 d after treatment inoculation. Pyrafluquinazon was not statistically different from cyazypyr or sulfoxaflor in percentage of plants with virus symptoms in any trial. Percentage virus in the cyazypyr and sulfoxaflor treatments was not statistically different in the 3 and 7 d after treatment inoculations.

Rarely have plant virologists, vector entomologists and crop specialists worked together in search of sustainable management practices for viral diseases. Historically, modelling approaches have been vector-based dealing with empirical forecasting systems or simulation of vector population dynamics. More recently, epidemiological models, such as those used in human/animal epidemiology, have been introduced in an attempt to characterize and analyse the population ecology of viral diseases. The theoretical bases for these models and their use in evaluating control strategies in terms of the interactions between host, virus and vector are considered here. Vector activity and behaviour, especially in relation to virus transmission, are important determinants of the rate and extent of epidemic development. The applicability and flexibility of these models are illustrated by reference to specific case studies, including the increasing importance of whitefly-transmitted viruses.

    abstract = {While feeding on host plants, viruliferous insects serve as vectors for viruses. Successful viral transmission depends on vector behavior. Two behaviors that impact viral transmission are vector aggregation and dispersal. Vector aggregation may be due to chemical or visual cues or feeding preferences. Vector dispersal can result in widespread disease outbreaks among susceptible host plants. These two behaviors are investigated in plant-vector-virus models. Deterministic and stochastic models are formulated to account for stages of infection, vector aggregation and local dispersal between adjacent crops. First, models for a single crop are studied with aggregation included implicitly through the acquisition and inoculation rates. Second, models with aggregation and dispersal of vectors are studied when one field contains a disease-sensitive crop and another a disease-resistant crop. Analytical expressions are computed for the basic reproduction number in the deterministic models and for the probability of disease extinction in the stochastic models. These two expressions provide useful measures to assess effects of aggregation and dispersal on the rate of disease spread within and between crops and the potential for an outbreak. The modeling framework is based on cassava mosaic virus that causes significant damage in cassava crops in Africa.},

Herein, our focus is on viruses that are transmitted from one plant to another by insect vectors. We consider predators that prey on insect population leading to reduction in infection transmission of plant diseases. Methods: We formulate and analyze a deterministic model for plant disease by incorporating predators as biological control agents. Existence of equilibria and the stability of the model are discussed in-detail. Basic reproduction number R0 of the proposed model is also computed and this helps in determining the impact of different key parameters on the transmission dynamics of disease. Additionally, the proposed model is extended to stochastic model and simulation results of both deterministic and stochastic models are compared and analyzed. Results: Our results of stochastic model show the less number of infected plants and insects compared to corresponding results for deterministic model. Also, our results analyze the impact of different key parameters on the equilibrium levels of infected plants and identify the key parameters. Discussion: Presented results are used to conclude and demonstrate that the biological control is effective in reducing the infection transmission of plant disease and there is a need to use plant-insect-specific predators to get desirable results.},

Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we derive the expression of the basic reproduction number (R 0) of HLB. The findings show that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R 0 < 1, and if R 0 > 1 the system is uniformly persistent. By applying the global sensitivity analysis of R 0, we can obtain some parameters that have the greatest influence on the HLB transmission dynamics. Additionally, the optimal control theory is used to explore the corresponding optimal control problem of the HLB model. Numerical simulations are conducted to reinforce the analytical results. These theoretical and numerical results provide useful insights for understanding the transmission dynamics of HLB and may help policy makers to develop intervention strategies for the disease.}},

However, plants are subject to virus diseases. In plants most of the virus propagation is done by a vector. The traditional way of controlling the insects is to use insecticides that have a negative effect on the environment. A more environmentally friendly way to control the insects is to use predators that will prey on the vector, such as birds or bats. In this paper we modify a plant-virus propagation model with delays. The model is written using delay differential equations. However, it can also be expressed in terms of biochemical reactions, which is more realistic for small populations. Since there are always variations in the populations, errors in the measured values and uncertainties, we use two methods to introduce randomness: stochastic differential equations and the Gillespie algorithm. We present numerical simulations. The Gillespie method produces good results for plant-virus population models.}},

In this study, we examined the growth parameters of tomato seedlings, including disease symptoms and the heights and weights of non-infected, singly infected and mixed infected tomato plants. Additionally, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the viruses in tomato plants, and the viral acquisition and transmission by B. tabaci MED, were determined. The results demonstrated that: (i) ToCV+TYLCV mixed infections induced tomato disease synergism, resulting in a high disease severity index and decreased stem heights and weights; (ii) as the disease progressed, TYLCV accumulated more in upper leaves of TYLCV-infected tomato plants than in lower leaves, whereas ToCV accumulated less in upper leaves of ToCV-infected tomato plants than in lower leaves; (iii) viral accumulation in ToCV+TYLCV mixed infected plants was greater than in singly infected plants; and (iv) B. tabaci MED appeared to have a greater TYLCV, but a lower ToCV, acquisition rate from mixed infected plants compared with singly infected plants. However, mixed infections did not affect transmission by whiteflies. Thus, ToCV+TYLCV mixed infections may induce synergistic disease effects in tomato plants.},

Spreading of the vectors, whiteflies of the Bemisia tabaci complex, has been responsible for many TYLCD outbreaks. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of TYLCV and TYLV-like begomoviruses and the driving forces of the increasing global significance through rapid evolution of begomovirus variants, mixed infection in the field, association with betasatellites and host range expansion. Breeding for host plant resistance is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable methods in controlling TYLCD. Resistance to TYLCD was found in several wild relatives of tomato from which six TYLCV resistance genes (Ty-1 to Ty-6) have been identified. Currently, Ty-1 and Ty-3 are the primary resistance genes widely used in tomato breeding programs. Ty-2 is also exploited commercially either alone or in combination with other Ty-genes (i.e., Ty-1, Ty-3 or ty-5). Additionally, screening of a large collection of wild tomato species has resulted in the identification of novel TYLCD resistance sources. In this review, we focus on genetic resources used to date in breeding for TYLCVD resistance. For future breeding strategies, we discuss several leads in order to make full use of the naturally occurring and engineered resistance to mount a broad-spectrum and sustainable begomovirus resistance.},

Quantitative infectivity assays using both natural infection in the field and artificial inoculation utilizing infectious TYLCV clones in a growth chamber were optimized and performed to investigate the individual and cumulative levels of resistance. We confirmed that Ty-2 could also be an effective source of resistance for TYLCV control, together with Ty-1.

    abstract = {Background: Whitefly is one of the most destructive sucking pest in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and causing significant crop losses directly by sucking sap from the plants and indirectly through the transmission of viral diseases specifically caused by the genus Begomovirus. The Begomovirus species viz., Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) and Mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) are causing yellow mosaic virus disease in soybean, which is transmitted by whiteflies. The disease accounts to 30-70 per cent yield loss and increases up to 80 - 100 per cent during severe incidence. Hence, there is a need for development of integrated pest management strategies against disease and whiteflies, for this the knowledge on virus-vector relationship is required. But, the studies on biological relationship of yellow mosaic virus disease and whitefly in soybean are scarce. At this juncture, considering the importance of disease in soybean, the present investigation was carried out to know the virus -vector relationship of the YMV and whitefly in soybean.Methods: The experiment on virus-vector relationship of yellow mosaic virus and whitefly in soybean was conducted at Department of Entomology, College of Agriculture, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand during 2016-17. The data on number of whiteflies per plant, acquisition and inoculation access feeding period and pre and post starvation period required for effective transmission of virus was recorded.Result: A single viruliferous whitefly was able to transmit virus and ten viruliferous whiteflies per plant were required for cent per cent transmission of virus. The minimum acquisition access and inoculation access feeding periods required for virus transmission was 0.25h (15 min) each; while the 100 per cent virus transmission was recorded with acquisition and inoculation period of 12h, each. The per cent transmission was increased with the increase of acquisition and inoculation periods. The rate of transmission was positively correlated with pre-acquisition starvation period and negatively correlated with post- acquisition starvation period.},

    abstract = {Sucking insects require a surface of plants on which the legs and the eggs of insects will adhere and to which insect mouthparts will access. The primary plant protection against insects is their surface property, which hinders the attachment of the insect's legs and eggs. The epicuticular waxes chemistry influences the fine structure of the cuticular surface. In current study, an attempt was made to investigate the variation of chemical compounds in epicuticular waxes of four cotton species that classify them resistant or susceptible i.e., Gossypium abroreum, G. hirsutum, G. arboreum wax deficient mutant (GaWM3) and G. harknessi which were evaluated for their interaction with whitefly and CLCuV transmission. Gossypium hirsutum an insect and CLCuV susceptible cotton variety, was found to have four compounds namely Trichloroacetic acid, hexadecylester, P-xylenolpthalein, 2-cyclo-pentene-1-ol, 1-phenyl-and Phenol, 2,5-bis [1,1- dimethyl] which could interact with chitin of whitefly while only two compounds in Gossypium arboreum an insect and CLCuV resistant cotton variety could interact with chitin of whitefly. Similarly, GaWM3 and Gossypium harkasnessi were found to have only a single compound. Number of whiteflies found on leaves of G. hirsutum was much higher as compared to other cotton species. Keeping this fact in mind a wax biosynthetic gene CER3, from Arabidopsis thaliana was transformed into G. hirsutum and the plants were evaluated for their resistance against whitefly and CLCuV transmission. In microscopic analysis transgenic plants clearly showed higher amounts of leaf waxes as compared to non-transgenics. The least whitefly population and CLCuV titer of <10,000 units was found in transgenic plants compared to non-transgenic cotton where it was ≈4.5X106 units that confirmed the role of wax in insect interaction and ultimately to CLCuV transmission. This study provides novel insight on wax related compounds involved in cotton-whitefly interaction, which potentially can help in developing more efficient control strategies for this destructive pest.},

    abstract  = {Petroleum-derived spray oils are long known to possess insecticidal activity. Lately, there is renewed interest in the use of mineral oils for the management of in-season spread of Potato virus Y (PVY) in seed potatoes. Mineral oils are environmentally benign and least prone to resistance development in target insect pests. Therefore, their use in integrated pest management is believed to be more sustainable in the long run. Mineral oils have been demonstrated to reduce the spread of PVY by more than 50\% in comparison with untreated control on many occasions. The usual practice is to apply 5 to 10 L per ha with season long spraying programme at weekly intervals. Mineral oils possess direct toxicity towards the vector aphids, interfere with feeding behaviour and binding of virions within the stylets of aphids, and impede the infection process post-inoculation. All these together or alone contribute to reducing the spread of non-persistent viruses like PVY in the field. However, the mineral oils show inconsistent performance over seasons. Also, the field spread of persistent viruses is not affected as much. Perhaps the most important limitation of mineral oils is the necessity for complete coverage of the foliage. Therefore, fresh foliage after treatment continues to be susceptible to probing by aphids and the consequent virus transmission. Furthermore, mineral oils are applied more frequently in the early season and also when the aphid flight activity is higher. In combination with other methods, e.g. insecticides and straw mulch, mineral oils have been demonstrated to be more efficacious on occasions. Mineral oils will continue to be an important component of pest management in future.},

    abstract = {Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV) is an aphid-transmitted potyvirus that causes severe yield losses in squash (Cucurbita moschata) production worldwide. Development of resistant cultivars using traditional breeding approaches relies on rigorous and resource-intensive phenotypic assays. QTL-seq, a whole genome re-sequencing based bulked segregant analysis, is a powerful tool for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in crop plants. In the current study, the QTL-seq approach was used to identify genetic loci associated with ZYMV resistance in an F2 population (n = 174) derived from a cross between Nigerian Local (resistant) and Butterbush (susceptible). Whole genome re-sequencing of the parents and bulks of resistant and susceptible F2 progeny revealed a mapping rate between 94.04\% and 98.76\%, and a final effective mapping depth ranging from 81.77 to 101.73 across samples. QTL-seq analysis identified four QTLs significantly (p < 0.05) associated with ZYMV resistance on chromosome 2 (QtlZYMV-C02), 4 (QtlZYMV-C04), 8 (QtlZYMV-C08) and 20 (QtlZYMV-C20). Seven markers within the QTL intervals were tested for association with ZYMV resistance in the entire F2 population. For QtlZYMV-C08, one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker (KASP-6) was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with ZYMV resistance, while two SNPs (KASP-1 and KASP-3) and an indel (Indel-2) marker were linked to resistance within QtlZYMV-C20. KASP-3 and KASP-6 are non-synonymous SNPs leading to amino acid substitutions in candidate disease resistant gene homologs on chromosomes 20 (CmoCh20G003040.1) and 8 (CmoCh08G007140.1), respectively. Identification of QTL and SNP markers associated with ZYMV resistance will facilitate marker-assisted selection for ZYMV resistance in squash.},

    abstract = {Cassava mosaic disease (CMD), caused by cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs), is a major threat to cassava production in Nigeria. The predominant CMBs in Nigeria are African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV), East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV) and East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV), which are transmitted through infected stem cuttings and whitefly vectors. This study was conducted in 2015 and 2017 to assess the epidemiology of CMD and the current distribution of CMBs in cassava farms in South West (SW) and North Central (NC) Nigeria. A survey of cassava farms was undertaken, and samples representative of disease symptoms were collected and assessed using molecular techniques. A total of 184 and 328 cassava farms were sampled in 2015 and 2017, respectively. CMD incidence for both regions surveyed was 43.80 and 12.25\% in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Fields in SW recorded a higher incidence rate in 2015 (SW: 45.11\%, NC: 42.47\%), while the reverse occurred in 2017 (SW: 10.90\%, NC: 14.01\%). Overall, the CMD incidence in Benue State (NC) was significantly higher than other locations surveyed in both years. CMD symptom severity and mean whitefly population were higher in SW Nigeria in the two survey years. ACMV was widespread across both zones, occurring in 79.1\% (453/613) and 54.8\% (386/704) of cassava leaf samples analysed in 2015 and 2017, respectively. EACMV was detected in only 6.0\% (37/613) and 4.7\% (33/704) of all cassava leaf samples analysed in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Overall, a higher proportion of infected samples were found in NC in both 2015 (NC: 85.2\%, SW: 75.4\%) and 2017 (NC: 73.6\%, SW: 45.2\%). Detection using strain-specific primers revealed that 97\% of EACMV positive samples were indeed infected by the EACMCV strain of the virus. As previously reported, samples with mixed infections showed a higher symptom severity than samples with single ACMV or EACMV infections. This study provides an update to the distribution of CMBs in SW and NC Nigeria and will be useful in development of monitoring and management strategies for the disease in both regions.},

    abstract  = {Chilli pepper is an important vegetable and spice crop grown worldwide. Chilli is susceptible to various pathogens, among them mosaic disease caused by Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a major constraint for its production. Roving survey was carried out for mosaic disease assessment in chilli at 35 locations comprising five districts of south eastern Karnataka, which was later confirmed for the presence of different viruses in random samples by DAC-ELISA. Results revealed the prevalence of the disease caused by CMV up to 43.00\% based on visual assessment. However, only in 64 samples out of 140 infected chilli samples showed CMV infection in DAC-ELISA and revealed the mixed infection of viruses. Mechanical sap inoculation of CMV-Ko isolate induced symptoms on chilli plants, which were similar to the symptoms observed in field. Complete genome sequence of CMV-Ko (RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3) isolate was amplified, cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that it shared 83.7–99.1\% nucleotide (nt) identity with CMV subgroup IB isolates infecting different crops in India. Recombination analysis of CMV-Ko genome showed that, RNA1 and RNA2 had recombinant origin and not RNA3. Host range studies for CMV-Ko isolate showed its potential of infecting nine host plants out of 21 used for transmission. Fifty advanced chilli lines were screened against CMV-Ko isolate and 27 immune lines to CMV were identified, which can be utilized for management of disease caused by CMV in chilli.},
